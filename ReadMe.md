### Region Filling and Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Image Inpainting

Implementation of the algorithm mentioned in the paper: [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1323101)

> Intructions to run the code:

**Note:** Keep all the .m files and images provided in the same folder

1. Go to main.m and change the image name to be used for the algorithm.
2. Run main.m to run the algorithm.
3. On running, a dialogue box will appear with all the instruction to select mask.
4. Once mask selection is over, algorithm will start running with a window showing each update.
